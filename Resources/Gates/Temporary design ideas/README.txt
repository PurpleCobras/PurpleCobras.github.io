So i had a lot of new designs, but all of them basically involed some variation of what's in these six

1. keeping the center of the gate a solid color, current circuit design. I'll definitely change the color for each kind of gate 
   either way because that seems to be the consensus.
2. Adding a glow around the gate. The glow could be either white or the color of the gate. From what I saw when I put 
   them against different backgrounds it seems that from a functional standpoint white is better because no matter whats
   behind it either the border or the glow contrast the background. But from an aesthetic standpoint the colored glows around
   the gates look kinda cool haha
3. changing the thickness of the border or making the color variation between gates something more subtle like the color of 
   numbers or the color of an outline etc.
4. I'll mess with the numbers inside of the gates as far as making them easier to read (like kevin suggested) after the rest of 
   the design is good.
   
   But basically im looking for suggestions on which combination of these things you guys think will make it look better. Or
   hopefully somebody has an idea I haven't thought of that would help make it look better. either way, let me know.
